# What are the types of governments?
There are a few types of governments to be aware of, especially in this day and age.
* A _`unitary` government_ has a centralized agency controlling everything.
* A _`federal` government_ has two mini-governments: a national and local government. An authority oversees both and both governments interact directly with the people.
* A _`confederate` government_ is an alliance of independent states.
* A _`dictatorship`_ is a government in which all of the power rests on a single person or a few people.
* A _`presidential` government_ has a separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches, with one to oversee both of them for a period of time. Both can check and regulate each other and rely on an outline or a constitution to determine separation.
* A _`parliamentary` government_ has an executive branch composed of a prime minister and a cabinet of people.
* An _`anarchy`_ is the lack of a government.

Turn this anarchy into a different type of government. Should it be a dictatorship, federal, or parliamentary government? Use the template code below to figure out what type of government would best work!
