# What are the origins of government?
It's not clearly known as to how governments came to be. However, there are four theories that try to explain how governments were formed:

* The _`evolutionary` theory_ works by creating a group or a clan in which they elect a leader to lead them.
* The _`divine` right theory_ assumes that a leader is "sent from above" or is related to religious figures and therefore should be superior to others, allowing them to be the leader and create a cult around them.
* The _`force` theory_ imposes ideals of someone or a group of people by means of physical, economical, or psychological behaviors.
* The _social `contract` theory_ is what the United States has in which the people agree to make a government and create a contract for it.

Using the code below, try to figure out which origin best matches this government.
